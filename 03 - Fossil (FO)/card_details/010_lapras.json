Its high 80 HP for a Basic Pokemon made it a reliable tank, and Water Gun's scalability with extra Water Energy meant it could threaten early while building up. Confuse Ray added disruption utility. While not as flashy as Blastoise itself, Lapras served as a consistent attacker in Water-based strategies.",
