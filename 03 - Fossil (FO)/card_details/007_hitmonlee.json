  "competitiveHistory": "Hitmonlee provided a unique role as a bench sniper in the Fossil era. Stretch Kick's ability to damage benched Pokemon without attacking the Active was valuable for setting up knockouts and disrupting opponent setup. It paired well with Gengar's Curse and other spread damage strategies. High Jump Kick gave it finishing power against active threats. While not as ubiquitous as Hitmonchan, Hitmonlee found its niche in certain deck archetypes.",
