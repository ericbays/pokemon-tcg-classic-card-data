Its Transform power created complex game states where players had to carefully consider what Pokemon to make active. It saw play in various control and disruption strategies. The ability to copy any Pokemon's attacks with flexible energy made it surprisingly versatile, though its low base HP and vulnerability to status conditions limited its effectiveness.",
