  "description": "Machoke is a Stage 1 Fighting-type Pok\u00e9mon that serves as the powerful middle evolution between Machop and Machamp. With 80 HP and two high-damage attacks, Machoke offers legitimate offensive threat despite being a transitional evolution. Karate Chop provides damage that decreases as Machoke takes hits, while Submission delivers consistent 60 damage at the cost of recoil. The high retreat cost and self-damaging mechanics create interesting strategic decisions around when to evolve and when to continue attacking.",
  "competitiveHistory": "Machoke saw moderate competitive play as part of Machamp evolution decks in the Base Set era. Unlike most middle-stage evolutions, Machoke was actually threatening enough to sometimes remain in play rather than being evolved immediately. The 50-60 damage output was competitive, though the self-damaging mechanics and Psychic weakness limited its appeal. Most tournament players preferred to use Pok\u00e9mon Breeder to skip directly to Machamp, but Machoke could hold its own when forced into combat. It was generally viewed as one of the better Stage 1 evolutions, though still inferior to the final Machamp form.",
