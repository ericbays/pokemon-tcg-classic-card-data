  "description": "Jynx is a unique Basic Psychic-type Pok\u00e9mon that combines coin flip mechanics with damage scaling based on the opponent's current damage. With 70 HP and no evolution, Jynx serves as a standalone attacker that can adapt to different situations - using Doubleslap for early game chip damage or Meditate to finish off wounded opponents. The damage-scaling mechanic makes Jynx particularly effective in the mid-to-late game when opponents have accumulated damage counters.",
  "competitiveHistory": "Jynx saw significant competitive play in the Base Set era, particularly in Haymaker-style decks where it served as an excellent cleanup attacker. The combination of 70 HP, low energy requirements, and Meditate's scaling damage made it a valuable inclusion in aggressive strategies. Tournament players appreciated that Jynx could be played immediately as a Basic and could punish opponents who were carefully managing their resources to avoid knockouts. While not a top-tier threat on its own, Jynx was a solid supporting attacker that found its way into many successful competitive decks.",
