  "description": "Ivysaur is the Stage 1 evolution of Bulbasaur and the intermediary step toward the powerful Venusaur. With 60 HP and two attacking options, Ivysaur can serve as either a transitional evolution or a functional mid-game attacker. Vine Whip provides straightforward damage, while Poisonpowder offers status disruption at the cost of reduced immediate damage. The low retreat cost and moderate HP make Ivysaur a flexible component in Grass-type evolution strategies.",
  "competitiveHistory": "Ivysaur's competitive role was almost exclusively as a necessary evolution step toward Venusaur in Energy Trans decks. Like most middle-stage evolutions, it was rarely intended as an active attacker in tournament play. Many competitive Venusaur decks used Pok\u00e9mon Breeder to bypass Ivysaur entirely, jumping directly from Bulbasaur to Venusaur. When Ivysaur did see active play, it was usually due to necessity rather than strategic choice, serving as a placeholder until Venusaur could be found and played.",
