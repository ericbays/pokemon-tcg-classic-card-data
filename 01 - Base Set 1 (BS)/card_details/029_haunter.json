  "description": "Haunter is a Stage 1 Psychic-type Pok\u00e9mon that employs a powerful sleep-lock strategy through its Hypnosis and Dream Eater combo. With 60 HP and no weakness, Haunter can establish control over opponents by forcing Sleep status and then dealing massive 50 damage while they're incapacitated. This combination makes Haunter one of the most effective status-based control Pok\u00e9mon in the Base Set, though its strategy relies on the opponent remaining Asleep.",
  "competitiveHistory": "Haunter saw moderate competitive play in the Base Set era, primarily as a component of Gengar evolution decks but occasionally as a standalone strategy. The Hypnosis-Dream Eater combo was powerful and could completely shut down unprepared opponents, making Haunter a legitimate threat. However, experienced players adapted by including Switch and maintaining developed benches, which reduced Haunter's effectiveness. The card was particularly strong in best-of-one formats where opponents might not be prepared, but struggled in longer tournament matches where players could sideboard or adapt.",
