  "description": "Kakuna is a Stage 1 Grass-type Pok\u00e9mon that represents the cocoon stage between Weedle and Beedrill. With an impressive 80 HP for a middle evolution, Kakuna focuses on survival and stalling rather than offense. Stiffen provides a defensive coin flip mechanic that can prevent damage, while Poisonpowder offers a low-damage attack with potential Poison status. While primarily serving as an evolution bridge to Beedrill, Kakuna's high HP gives it unusual durability for a transitional Pok\u00e9mon.",
  "competitiveHistory": "Kakuna saw minimal competitive play in the Base Set era. While its 80 HP was notable, the coin flip reliance and minimal damage output made it impractical as an attacker. Most Beedrill decks used Pok\u00e9mon Breeder to skip Kakuna entirely, and even when Kakuna was included, it was never intended to see active play. The card's competitive value was essentially zero - it existed purely as a necessary evil for evolution purposes. Even casual players generally preferred to evolve past it rather than utilize its defensive mechanics.",
