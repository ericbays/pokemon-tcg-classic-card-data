  "description": "Growlithe is a solid Basic Fire-type Pok\u00e9mon that serves as the foundation for the powerful Arcanine evolution. With 60 HP and a simple but effective 20-damage attack, Growlithe can function as both an early game attacker and a setup card for Arcanine. Its reasonable energy cost and low retreat cost make it a reliable component in Fire-type strategies, though its Water weakness can be a significant liability in certain matchups.",
  "competitiveHistory": "Growlithe saw regular play as a necessary component of Arcanine decks in the Base Set era. While it could function as a basic attacker, its primary value was as evolution material. In competitive settings, Growlithe was judged more on its ability to survive long enough to evolve rather than its attacking capabilities. The prevalence of Water-type decks (particularly Rain Dance) made Growlithe vulnerable, but Fire decks still included it out of necessity for accessing Arcanine.",
