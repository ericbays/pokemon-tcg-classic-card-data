  "competitiveHistory": "Professor Oak is one of the most iconic and powerful cards in Pokemon TCG history. It was an automatic 4-of staple in virtually every competitive Base Set deck. The ability to draw 7 cards with no real downside (discarding is often advantageous) made it indispensable for consistency. Oak defined the aggressive playstyle of early Pokemon TCG, enabling decks like Haymaker to explode out of the gate with turn 1 setups.",
