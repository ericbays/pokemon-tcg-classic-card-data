    "notes": "Extremely valuable card in Base Set. Because it doesn't count as a Basic Energy, it cannot be searched with Energy Search or returned from the discard pile with Super Energy Removal defense. Limited to 4 copies per deck makes it highly contested in decks that need it. Works with any Pokemon that has Colorless energy in their attack costs."
