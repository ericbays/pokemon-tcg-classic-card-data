  "competitiveHistory": "Impostor Professor Oak is infamous in competitive Pokemon TCG as one of the most overrated cards by new players. While hand disruption sounds appealing in theory, giving your opponent 7 fresh cards almost always benefits them more than it hurts them. Competitive players quickly identified it as a trap card and avoided it entirely. The card became a running joke in the community and an educational example of why giving your opponent resources is generally a bad idea.",
