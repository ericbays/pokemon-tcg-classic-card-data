  "description": "Magikarp is the weakest Basic Pok\u00e9mon in the Base Set, featuring a mere 30 HP and minimal offensive capability. However, this famously feeble Fish Pok\u00e9mon evolves into the fearsome Gyarados, one of the most powerful cards in the set. Magikarp's Flail attack offers an interesting damage-scaling mechanic that increases as it takes damage, creating a risk-reward dynamic where a nearly-defeated Magikarp can potentially deal significant damage before being knocked out or evolved.",
  "competitiveHistory": "Magikarp saw play exclusively as a necessary component for accessing Gyarados in the Base Set era. No competitive player valued Magikarp for its own capabilities - it was purely evolution material. The 30 HP made it a liability, and experienced opponents would target Magikarp with Gust of Wind for easy prizes. Despite this, Gyarados was powerful enough that some players were willing to deal with Magikarp's extreme weakness. The card became somewhat notorious as the ultimate 'worthless until evolved' Pok\u00e9mon, though it retained cult popularity due to its video game legacy.",
