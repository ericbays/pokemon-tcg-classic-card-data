  "description": "Kadabra is a Stage 1 Psychic-type Pok\u00e9mon that bridges the gap between the fragile Abra and the powerful Alakazam. With 60 HP and two distinct abilities, Kadabra can serve as both a self-sustaining attacker and a transitional evolution. Recover provides full healing at the cost of energy discard, while Super Psy delivers solid 50 damage. The high retreat cost and energy requirements make Kadabra a commitment, but its healing capability and respectable damage output provide value in Psychic-type strategies.",
  "competitiveHistory": "Kadabra saw significant competitive play as a necessary component of Alakazam decks, which were top-tier in the Base Set era. While rarely used as a standalone attacker in tournaments, Kadabra was valued for its ability to stall with Recover while players searched for Alakazam and built their board state. The 50 damage from Super Psy meant Kadabra wasn't completely helpless while waiting to evolve, making it better than most middle-stage evolutions. In the right circumstances, Kadabra could hold its own, but it was generally seen as a placeholder for the superior Alakazam.",
