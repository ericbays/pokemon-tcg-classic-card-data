  "competitiveHistory": "Dark Charizard was a fan-favorite collector card but saw minimal competitive play due to its unreliable Continuous Fireball attack. The coin flip mechanic made damage output wildly inconsistent - you could deal 0 damage or 200+ damage on the same turn. The energy discard on heads also made it unsustainable. Competitively, the original Base Set Charizard's guaranteed 100 damage was generally preferred despite its own drawbacks.",

    {
      "ruling": "You must discard Fire Energy cards equal to the number of heads, even if it means discarding all your Fire Energy.",

    {
      "ruling": "If you flip all tails, the attack does 0 damage and you discard no energy.",
