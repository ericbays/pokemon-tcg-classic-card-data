  "competitiveHistory": "Dark Golbat became a staple in the infamous 'Sneak Attack' deck archetype. The ability to repeatedly evolve, deal 10 damage with Sneak Attack, then use Scoop Up to return it to hand and do it again created a powerful damage engine. Combined with spread damage from Flitter targeting benched Pokemon, Dark Golbat enabled control strategies that slowly accumulated damage across the opponent's board. Free retreat made it very flexible tactically.",
