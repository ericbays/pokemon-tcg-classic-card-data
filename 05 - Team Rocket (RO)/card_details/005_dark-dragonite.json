Getting two Basic Pokemon from your deck when you evolve was powerful, especially for decks relying on bench presence. However, Giant Tail's coin flip reliability issues and low HP for a Stage 2 limited its overall competitive impact. It was primarily used as a tech card for the Pokemon Power rather than as a main attacker.",
