  "competitiveHistory": "Dark Vileplume was one of the most format-defining cards from Team Rocket. Hay Fever's complete Trainer lock created an entirely new archetype focused on locking out Trainer cards. Decks were built around getting Dark Vileplume into play quickly, then relying on Pokemon abilities and attacks while the opponent struggled without their Trainers. The 'Vileplume Lock' strategy remained relevant for years and influenced deck building significantly.",
