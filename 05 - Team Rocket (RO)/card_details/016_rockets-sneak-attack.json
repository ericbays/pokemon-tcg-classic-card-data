  "competitiveHistory": "Rocket's Sneak Attack was one of the most powerful disruption cards from Team Rocket. Looking at the opponent's hand provided valuable information, and removing a key Trainer could derail their strategy. It was especially devastating against combo decks relying on specific Trainer cards. Many competitive decks ran multiple copies for consistent early disruption.",
