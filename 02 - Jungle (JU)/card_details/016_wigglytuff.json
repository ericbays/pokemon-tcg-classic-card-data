  "competitiveHistory": "Wigglytuff from Jungle was one of the most powerful and feared cards in early Pokemon TCG history. The 'Do the Wave' deck archetype built around this card rivaled Haymaker as the top competitive strategy. With a full bench, Wigglytuff dealt 60 damage for just 3 Colorless energy (easily achieved turn 2 with Double Colorless Energy), which was one PlusPower away from knocking out the format's best Basic Pokemon. The deck typically paired Wigglytuff with Scyther and Hitmonchan to fill the bench with efficient attackers. Do the Wave established a damage formula that would be revisited many times in future cards like Raichu XY and Zoroark. Some players reportedly hated this deck so much they would tear up Wigglytuff cards before tournaments.",
