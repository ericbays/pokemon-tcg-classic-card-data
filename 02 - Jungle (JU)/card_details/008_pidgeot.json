  "competitiveHistory": "Pidgeot from Jungle had an interesting niche with its Hurricane attack, which could reset an opponent's evolved Pokemon and all their attached energy. However, the Stage 2 evolution requirement, 4 energy cost, and the limitation that it doesn't work on KOs limited its competitive viability. The free retreat was appreciated but not enough to make it a tournament staple. It saw occasional play in control-oriented decks but was not a meta-defining card.",
