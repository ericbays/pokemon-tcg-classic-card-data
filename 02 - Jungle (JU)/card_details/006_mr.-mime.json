  "competitiveHistory": "Mr. Mime from Jungle was one of the most iconic and competitively significant cards from the set. Its Invisible Wall Pokemon Power completely invalidated heavy hitters, making it a cornerstone of stall and control strategies. The famous 'Mr. Mime/Alakazam' deck used Damage Swap to move the small amounts of damage off Mr. Mime to tanky benched Pokemon. Mr. Mime was a meta-defining card that forced opponents to include answers for it, and it remained relevant throughout the Base Set era. It was particularly effective against Haymaker's big attackers like Hitmonchan and Electabuzz.",
