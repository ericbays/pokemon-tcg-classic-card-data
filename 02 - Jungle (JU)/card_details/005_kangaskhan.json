  "competitiveHistory": "Kangaskhan from Jungle saw significant competitive play primarily as a setup Pokemon. Its Fetch attack allowed decks to draw cards while building up the bench, making it valuable in the early game. The 90 HP made it durable enough to survive while fetching. However, Comet Punch was rarely used competitively due to its inconsistency and high energy cost. Kangaskhan was commonly seen in stall decks and as an early game wall in various archetypes.",

      "ruling": "Comet Punch requires you to flip all 4 coins. You cannot choose to flip fewer.",

    },
    {
      "ruling": "If you flip 0 heads on Comet Punch, the attack does 0 damage but is still considered to have been used.",
