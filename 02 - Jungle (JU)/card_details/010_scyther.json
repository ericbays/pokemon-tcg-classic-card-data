  "competitiveHistory": "Scyther from Jungle is widely considered one of the best cards from the original sets and a defining card of the Base Set era. It became an instant staple in the Haymaker archetype, replacing Farfetch'd as the third member of the Hitmonchan/Electabuzz core. Scyther's combination of 70 HP, free retreat, Fighting resistance (which countered Hitmonchan mirrors), and Colorless energy costs made it the most splashable and versatile Basic Pokemon available. The Swords Dance + Double Colorless Energy + Plus Power combo could achieve turn 2 knockouts on most Pokemon. Scyther was so powerful that it was included in virtually every competitive deck regardless of type focus, and it remained a format staple until rotation. Many veteran players consider it the best Pokemon in the game's first three sets.",
