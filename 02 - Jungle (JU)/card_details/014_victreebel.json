  "competitiveHistory": "Victreebel from Jungle was an interesting control option but saw limited competitive play. The Lure attack provided a Gust of Wind-like effect on a Pokemon, allowing players to drag up weak benched Pokemon for easy knockouts. However, the Stage 2 evolution requirement and low damage output made it too slow and weak for serious tournament play. Gust of Wind Trainer card was simply more efficient for the same effect.",
