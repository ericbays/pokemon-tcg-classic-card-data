  "competitiveHistory": "Nidoqueen from Jungle saw very limited competitive play. While the Boyfriends attack had interesting synergy with Nidoking, requiring two separate Stage 2 evolution lines made the deck too slow and inconsistent for tournament play. The Nidoking/Nidoqueen archetype was considered a fun casual deck but could not compete with faster strategies like Haymaker or more efficient evolution decks like Rain Dance. Mega Punch was decent but not worth the evolution investment.",
