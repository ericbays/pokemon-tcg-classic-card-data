  "competitiveHistory": "Snorlax from Jungle was a solid defensive option that saw play in control and stall strategies. Its Thick Skinned Pokemon Power made it immune to status conditions, which was valuable against decks relying on Paralysis or Poison for control. The card found a niche in Dark Vileplume lock decks after Team Rocket released, where the combination of Trainer lock and status immunity made it difficult for opponents to deal with multiple high-HP Pokemon. However, Muk's Toxic Gas could disable Thick Skinned, and the 4-energy 30-damage attack was not efficient enough for offensive decks.",

    {
      "ruling": "If Thick Skinned is disabled by Goop Gas Attack or Muk, Snorlax can be inflicted with status conditions. When the power reactivates, existing Poison is removed but Asleep/Confused/Paralyzed remain.",
