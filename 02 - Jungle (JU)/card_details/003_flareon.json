  "competitiveHistory": "Flareon from Jungle saw limited competitive play. While Flamethrower's 60 damage was respectable, the 4 energy cost and required energy discard made it less efficient than other Fire options like Arcanine. The Water weakness was particularly problematic in a meta where Blastoise Rain Dance was dominant. Flareon was primarily used in casual Eeveelution-themed decks rather than top-tier competitive builds.",
