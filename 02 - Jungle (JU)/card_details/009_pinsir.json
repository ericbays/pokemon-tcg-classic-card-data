  "competitiveHistory": "Pinsir from Jungle was not considered competitively viable. With only 60 HP as a Basic Pokemon, it was too fragile compared to the Haymaker staples like Hitmonchan (70 HP) and Scyther (70 HP with resistance). The coin-flip paralysis on Irongrip was unreliable, and Guillotine's 4-energy cost was inefficient. Scyther was simply a better Grass-type option for competitive play due to its free retreat, Fighting resistance, and Colorless energy costs.",
