  "competitiveHistory": "Vileplume from Jungle was not competitively viable due to its self-inflicted Confusion from Petal Dance. While the potential for 120 damage was exciting, the coin-flip nature and guaranteed Confusion made it too unreliable for tournament play. The Heal Pokemon Power was a nice bonus but also coin-dependent. Players preferred more consistent options, and this Vileplume was largely outclassed. Note that this is different from Dark Vileplume (Team Rocket) which had a much more impactful Trainer-locking power.",
