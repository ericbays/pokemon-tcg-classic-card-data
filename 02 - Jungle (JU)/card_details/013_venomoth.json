  "competitiveHistory": "Venomoth from Jungle was a niche card that saw occasional play due to its unique Shift Pokemon Power. The ability to change types allowed for creative plays exploiting weakness, but the low damage output of Venom Powder limited its practical applications. The free retreat cost was appreciated, but Venomoth was generally outclassed by more straightforward attackers. It remained a curiosity rather than a competitive staple.",
