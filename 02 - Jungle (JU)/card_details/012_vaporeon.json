  "competitiveHistory": "Vaporeon from Jungle was considered the most competitive of the three Eeveelutions due to its synergy with Blastoise's Rain Dance. With Rain Dance accelerating Water energy, Vaporeon could quickly power up Water Gun to deal 50 damage per turn. However, it faced stiff competition from other Water Pokemon in Rain Dance builds, and the Lightning weakness made it vulnerable to Electabuzz. It saw occasional play in Eeveelution-themed decks and as a Rain Dance attacker option.",
